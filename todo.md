# Todo

## Urgent 
- Figure out why DfsBinaryGroupFinderTest is not working.

## Medium
- Add tests to VideoProcessorTest
- Test that main correctly filters non-video files
- Update documentation and comments (everywhere!)

## Low / Aspirational
- User can set frequency of image collection
- Add fourth column to CSV that sayd "left", "mid", "right"
    - User set locations of boundaries
    - User set names of sections
- Create video representation of centroid moving 
    - (Make new video with same dimesions as original, just display largest centroid [maybe with a green circle])
