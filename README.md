## *DO THIS FIRST* Wave 0: AI Rules 
AI is *NOT ALLOWED* for generating implementations of the classes.
AI is allowed for helping you make test cases.

Don't have it just create the tests mindlessly for you though! Make sure you're actively involved in making the tests.

DO NOT MIX HUMAN AND AI COMMITS.
EVERY COMMIT THAT USES AI MUST START WITH THE COMMIT MESSAGE "AI Used" AND IT MUST ONLY CREATE/ALTER TEST FILES

For this wave, please have each partner make a commit below with their username acknowledging that they understand the rules, according to the following format:

"I, YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME, understand that AI is ONLY to be used for tests, and that every commit that I use AI for must start with 'AI Used'"

## Wave 1: Understand
Read through ImageSummaryApp in detail with your partner. Understand what each part does. This will involve looking through and reading ALL of the other classes records and interfaces. This will take a long time, but it is worth it! Do not skimp on this part, you will regret it!

As you read through the files, take notes in notes.md to help you and your partner undertsnad. Make frequent commits to your notes.

## Wave 2: Implement DfsBinaryGroupFinder
This class takes in a binary image array and finds the connected groups. It will look very similar in many ways to the explorer problem you did for DFS! You'll need to understand the Group record to do this well.

Consider STARTING with the unit tests. Remember, you can use AI to help with the unit tests but NOT the implementation. Any AI commit must start with the message "AI Used"

## Wave 3: Implement EuclideanColorDistance
Implement EuclideanColorDistance. You may consider adding a helper method for converting a hex int into R, G, and B components.

Again, consider starting with unit tests. You may consider using WolframAlpha to help you get correct expected values.

## Wave 4: Implement DistanceImageBinarizer
To do this you will need to research `java.awt.image.BufferedImage`. In particular, make sure to understand `getRGB` and `setRGB`. When creating a new image, you can use the below to start the instance:

```
new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);
```

Note that a lot of this class will be calling methods in BinaryGroupFinder and ColorDistanceFinder!

## Wave 5: Implement BinarizingImageGroupFinder
This implementation will be relatively short! It will mostly be calling methods in ImageBinarizer and BinaryGroupFinder.

## Wave 6: Validation
TODO
